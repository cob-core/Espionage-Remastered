adv_dip_event.1.t: "Comet Sighted!"
adv_dip_event.1.d: "A brilliant comet has appeared in the night sky, causing widespread anxiety among the populace. Street corners buzz with dire predictions and apocalyptic interpretations."
adv_dip_event.1.f: "The Interior Minister's morning briefing was interrupted by an agitated astronomer from the Royal Observatory. \n\n"A comet, sir! Visible to the naked eye!" he exclaimed, spreading star charts across the desk. "The common folk are in quite a state about it. Street preachers claim it heralds the end times, factory workers whisper it portends revolution, and the papers are printing the most sensational theories." \n\nThrough the window, crowds could be seen gathering in the square, pointing at the sky even in broad daylight. The Minister sighed, reaching for his pen. Something would have to be done to maintain order."
adv_dip_event.1.a: "The economy, fools!"
adv_dip_event.1.b: "If only we had comet sense..."
adv_dip_event.1.c: "Let us consult the Royal Observatory."
adv_dip_event.1.e: "Surely this is a sign of progress!"

adv_dip_event.21.t: "Support Nationalists"
adv_dip_event.21.d: "The proud [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Secret Service's espionage operations against [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] have taken a major step forward. They are convinced that with a little support they can achieve the complete success of the operation."
adv_dip_event.21.f: "The intelligence officer adjusted his spectacles, spreading a detailed map across the Minister's desk. Red pins marked potential uprising locations throughout the [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]'s territory. \n\n"Our agents have cultivated relationships with several nationalist movements," he explained, voice low despite the closed door. "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Secret Service believes that with modest financial support and a few well-placed weapons shipments, we could transform simmering resentment into open rebellion." \n\nThe Minister traced his finger along provincial boundaries where oppressed cultures strained against their rulers. "And naturally, these newly independent nations would remember who supported their cause?" \n\nThe officer's thin smile provided all the confirmation needed. "They would indeed, sir. They would indeed."
adv_dip_event.21.b: "Nevermind."

adv_dip_event.22.t: "Rise of Nationalists"
adv_dip_event.22.d: "Nationalists who support an independence of the [SCOPE.sCulture('discriminated_culture').GetName] people suddenly rose up. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] intelligence believes that this is not natural and that the enemy is behind it."
adv_dip_event.22.f: "The governor's morning tea was interrupted by urgent knocking. An aide burst in, clutching a telegram. \n\n"Nationalist agitators, sir—[SCOPE.sCulture('discriminated_culture').GetName] separatists—have seized the municipal buildings in three towns. They're flying their own flag and distributing pamphlets demanding independence." \n\nThe governor set down his cup with forced calm. "And their weaponry?" \n\n"Modern rifles, sir. Foreign manufacture." \n\n"I see." The room fell silent save for the ticking clock. "This is not some spontaneous uprising. This bears the hallmark of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] interference." He sighed, reaching for pen and paper. "Alert the garrison. I must inform the capital.""
adv_dip_event.22.a: "I'm sure the authorities can handle it."
adv_dip_event.22.b: "Subdue them."

adv_dip_event.31.t: "Support for Liberty"
adv_dip_event.31.d: "The proud [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Secret Service's espionage operations against [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] have taken a major step forward. They are convinced that with a little support they can achieve the complete success of the operation."
adv_dip_event.31.f: "Maps of [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] covered the situation room walls, dotted with notations marking government buildings, military installations, and transportation hubs. \n\n"Their dissatisfaction with [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country_overlord').GetName] rule grows daily," the intelligence director explained. "We've identified key sympathizers within their administration and military. With proper funding and encouragement, we could transform this discontent into a full independence movement." \n\nThe Foreign Minister drummed his fingers thoughtfully. "And once independent, they would naturally seek new alliances..." \n\n"Precisely, sir. A new nation, grateful to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], positioned directly on [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country_overlord').GetName]'s border." \n\nThe potential implications hung silently in the air between them."
adv_dip_event.31.a: "We should put some more money into this."
adv_dip_event.31.b: "Nevermind."

adv_dip_event.32.t: "Anonymous Investor"
adv_dip_event.32.d: "Recently, some [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] citizens have been raising their voices of dissatisfaction with [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country_overlord').GetName]. They are continuing to invest in various arms industries while demanding independence from [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country_overlord').GetName]."
adv_dip_event.32.f: "The police commissioner's report lay open on the Interior Minister's desk, its contents troubling. \n\n"These arms manufacturers report substantial investments from anonymous sources," the commissioner explained. "Coincidentally, anti-[SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country_overlord').GetName] sentiment has quadrupled in affected regions, with increasingly organized protests demanding independence." \n\nThe Minister gazed out at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s peaceful capital. "You suspect foreign involvement?" \n\n"The timing is suspicious, sir. These 'citizens' groups' materialized overnight with surprising organization and funding. Their rhetoric parallels our rivals' recent diplomatic statements almost verbatim." \n\n"How convenient," the Minister murmured. "How very convenient.""
adv_dip_event.32.a: "Is there any need for that?"
adv_dip_event.32.b: "Definitely suspicious."

adv_dip_event.33.t: "A Disquieting Rumor"
adv_dip_event.33.d: "Recently, some [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] citizens have been raising their voices of dissatisfaction with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. They are continuing to invest in various arms industries while demanding independence from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
adv_dip_event.33.f: "The Security Minister's morning briefing had taken an uncomfortable turn. \n\n"Reports from multiple provinces indicate coordinated unrest," the intelligence officer explained. "Pamphlets demanding independence are being distributed at factories and universities. More concerning, sir, is evidence of substantial foreign investment in domestic arms production." \n\n"[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] subjects don't simply wake up one morning collectively deciding to arm themselves," the Minister replied sharply. "What foreign entities are involved?" \n\nThe officer hesitated. "We have reason to suspect [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] intelligence services, sir. The rhetoric, timing, and methods bear their hallmarks." \n\nA heavy silence filled the chamber as implications settled like dust."
adv_dip_event.33.a: "Is there any need for that?"
adv_dip_event.33.b: "Definitely suspicious."

adv_dip_event.61.t: "Dispatch of Advisors"
adv_dip_event.61.d: "The glorious advisory group of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is ready to set off for [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. Although sending them will cost a little money, it will be of great help to close cooperation with the other country and industrial development."
adv_dip_event.61.f: "The selected advisors stood at attention as the Foreign Minister inspected their credentials. Engineers, economists, industrial experts—the finest minds [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] could offer. \n\nGentlemen, your mission in [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] is ostensibly to assist with industrial development," the Minister explained, pacing slowly. "However, your true purpose extends beyond mere technical consultation." \n\nHe paused, ensuring his next words registered clearly. "You will be our eyes and ears. You will identify weaknesses, catalog resources, and cultivate relationships with influential figures. You will lay groundwork for deeper cooperation—on our terms." \n\nThe advisors nodded solemnly. Their diplomatic passports would open doors; what happened after those doors opened was the true mission."
adv_dip_event.61.a: "Dispatch."
adv_dip_event.61.b: "Nevermind."

adv_dip_event.62.t: "Attaché of the Military Kind"
adv_dip_event.62.d: "The glorious advisory group of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is ready to set off for [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. Although sending them will cost a little money, it will be of great help to close cooperation with the other country and military development."
adv_dip_event.62.f: "The military attachés received their next briefing in the War Ministry's secure chamber. Maps of [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]'s defensive installations and troop deployments covered one wall. \n\n"Your official purpose is to share our expertise in modern warfare," the General explained. "You will train their officers, modernize their tactics, and assess their capabilities." \n\nHe let the statement hang before continuing more quietly, "You will also catalog every weakness, every vulnerability in their defenses. You will document their readiness, their supply lines, and their command structure." \n\nOne attache raised an eyebrow. "So we're to build them up while simultaneously preparing for their potential downfall?" \n\nThe General's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Precisely, Colonel. That is the art of military diplomacy.""
adv_dip_event.62.a: "Dispatch."
adv_dip_event.62.b: "Nevermind."

adv_dip_event.63.t: "An Exchange of Culture"
adv_dip_event.63.d: "The glorious advisory group of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is ready to set off for [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. Although sending them will cost a little money, it will be of great help to close cooperation with the other country and cultural development."
adv_dip_event.63.f: "The cultural delegation gathered in the Foreign Ministry's grand hall, surrounded by crates of books, musical instruments, and artistic supplies—the visible components of their mission. \n\n"Your official purpose in [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] is cultural exchange," the undersecretary explained. "You will establish libraries, organize concerts, and hold exhibitions celebrating our shared humanities." \n\nHis voice lowered. "However, cultural influence is merely the beginning. Through these activities, you will identify intellectuals sympathetic to our worldview, cultivate relationships with influential families, and gradually reshape their societal outlooks to align with ours." \n\nA renowned composer raised his hand. "So we're to win hearts and minds today for political advantage tomorrow?" \n\n"Precisely," came the cool reply. "Cultural dominance precedes all other forms of power.""
adv_dip_event.63.a: "Dispatch."
adv_dip_event.63.b: "Nevermind."

adv_dip_event.64.t: "Foreign Advisors Arrive"
adv_dip_event.64.d: "A delegation of advisors has arrived in our capital, offering their expertise in industrial development. While their assistance comes at a cost, their knowledge could prove valuable to our nation's growth."
adv_dip_event.64.f: "The grand reception hall bustled with activity as the foreign advisors presented their credentials. Engineers, economists, and industrial experts stood in neat rows, their polished appearances matching their prestigious reputations. \n\n"We are honored to receive such distinguished assistance," the Minister of Industry declared, though some of his aides exchanged worried glances. "Your expertise will surely accelerate our development." \n\nYet as the delegation toured our facilities, keen eyes took careful notes, and pointed questions about our infrastructure and resources seemed to probe deeper than mere technical interest warranted. \n\nThe Minister's secretary leaned in close, whispering, "They seem rather... thorough in their assessments, sir." \n\n"Indeed," the Minister replied softly. "One might wonder what other purposes such detailed knowledge might serve.""
adv_dip_event.64.a: "Welcome our esteemed guests."

adv_dip_event.65.t: "Military Attaché Arrives"
adv_dip_event.65.d: "A delegation of military attachés has arrived to share their expertise. While they claim their mission is to modernize our armed forces, some of our officers are wary of their true intentions."
adv_dip_event.65.f: "The War Ministry's grand hall echoed with the sharp click of boots as foreign officers conducted their inspection. Their pristine uniforms and polished decorations drew admiring glances from our junior officers.\n\n"Their tactical doctrine is quite advanced," the Chief of Staff admitted privately. "Yet I can't shake the feeling they're cataloging more than just training deficiencies." \n\nIndeed, the attachés' questions about supply routes, defensive positions, and command structures seemed to probe beyond mere professional courtesy. \n\n"They take such detailed notes," an aide whispered. "One wonders whose desk in [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] will eventually see them.""
adv_dip_event.65.a: "We can learn much from their expertise."

adv_dip_event.66.t: "Cultural Delegation Arrives"
adv_dip_event.66.d: "Representatives have arrived with promises of cultural exchange and artistic collaboration. Their presence has already begun to influence our society's elite circles."
adv_dip_event.66.f: "The National Theater buzzed with excitement as foreign artists unpacked crates of books, musical instruments, and paintings. The cultural delegation had barely arrived, yet already the capital's salons were arranging soirées in their honor.\n\n"Such fascinating perspectives they bring," the Minister of Culture observed, watching a foreign composer discuss theory with local musicians. "Though I notice they seem particularly interested in our more... influential families."\n\nIndeed, the delegation's charm offensive appeared carefully targeted. Every exhibition, every concert, every literary discussion somehow attracted those closest to power.\n\nA senior civil servant adjusted his cravat nervously. "They're not just spreading culture, are they? They're building a network.""
adv_dip_event.66.a: "Art knows no borders!"

adv_dip_event.11.t: "Sprinkle the Seeds of Discontent"
adv_dip_event.11.d: "The proud [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Secret Service's espionage operations against [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] have taken a major step forward. They are convinced that with a little support they can achieve the complete success of the operation."
adv_dip_event.11.f: "The Foreign Minister reviewed the dossier with growing satisfaction. Months of patient work by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s intelligence services had identified precisely which grievances to exploit in [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. \n\n"Our agents are positioned in key locations," the intelligence director reported. "Union leaders, university professors, newspaper editors—all ready to amplify existing frustrations. A modest investment now will yield considerable civil unrest within weeks." \n\n"And naturally, when their government struggles to maintain order..." \n\n"We'll be positioned to offer alternatives, sir. Economic partnerships, security agreements—whatever serves our interests once they're sufficiently desperate." \n\nThe Minister's pen hovered over the authorization form. One signature to destabilize a nation."
adv_dip_event.11.a: "Execute the order."
adv_dip_event.11.b: "Nevermind."

adv_dip_event.12.t: "Discontent Within the Populace"
adv_dip_event.12.d: "Recently, some citizens have been raising their voices of dissatisfaction with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. People are purchasing weapons and appear to be taking to the street in concerning amounts."
adv_dip_event.12.f: "The police chief's report landed on the Cabinet table with a troubling thud. \n\n"Coordinated protests have erupted in seven cities simultaneously," he explained, dark circles under his eyes betraying sleepless nights. "The troubling pattern isn't merely their synchronization, but their weaponry—new rifles appearing in civilian hands overnight." \n\nThe Interior Minister frowned. "Spontaneous demonstrations don't arrive with matching firearms." \n\n"No, sir. We've intercepted communications suggesting foreign involvement, more specifically operatives providing both financial backing and military-grade weapons." \n\nAround the table, ministers exchanged concerned glances. What had begun as scattered complaints had transformed into an organized movement with disturbing speed—and with external support."
adv_dip_event.12.a: "That is not ideal."
adv_dip_event.12.b: "We must invest in destroying dissent."

adv_dip_event.71.t: "The Night Manager"
adv_dip_event.71.d: "Shipments of weapons, explosives, and more from generous donors are making their way across the borders of [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. We'll soon see the fruit of our labour as men on the front lines fire weapons with our branding on them. "
adv_dip_event.71.f: "In a nondescript warehouse near the border, the intelligence operative checked manifests against inventory. Crates of rifles, ammunition, and explosives stood ready for transport, their original manufacturing marks carefully replaced with forgeries. \n\n"The local contacts have cleared the route," his assistant reported quietly. "Customs officials have been paid. These weapons will reach the separatists by Thursday." \n\nThe operative nodded, signing off on the final paperwork with a fictitious name. "And they'll be firing them by Sunday, creating precisely the border incident we require." \n\nHe closed the ledger with satisfaction. Officially, these weapons didn't exist. Officially, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] had no involvement whatsoever in the region's growing instability. \n\nUnofficially, the mission was proceeding exactly as planned."
adv_dip_event.71.a: "Sell. More. Guns."
adv_dip_event.71.b: "Perfect, carry on gentlemen."

adv_dip_event.81.t: "Golden Pockets"
adv_dip_event.81.d: "A plot of intrigue and espionage has gotten us into some important places. We now have infiltrated [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] and could persuade certain party members to our influence."
adv_dip_event.81.f: "The diplomatic attaché closed the embassy safe with a satisfied click. Inside lay detailed profiles of influential [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] politicians—their debts, vices, ambitions, and weaknesses meticulously cataloged. \n\n"We've identified three primary targets," he explained to his superior. "A cabinet minister with gambling debts, a party secretary with expensive tastes, and a rising star with political ambitions exceeding his current means." \n\n"And their price?" \n\n"Varied but manageable. Financial assistance, promises of future support, arrangements for their children to attend our universities." He smiled thinly. "Everyone has a price—we've simply been methodical in discovering what each one values most." \n\n"Excellent. Begin with the rising star—youth is always more malleable than experience.""
adv_dip_event.81.a: "A New Friend."
adv_dip_event.81.b: "Not at this time."

adv_dip_event.82.t: "A Shift in the Political Scene"
adv_dip_event.82.d: "Certain characters in government appear to be getting extreme amounts of external support and appear to be gaining tremendous momentum."
adv_dip_event.82.f: "The Security Minister slammed the intelligence report onto the cabinet table. \n\n"Three newly prominent political figures have received substantial donations from shell companies we've traced back to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]," he announced grimly. "Their sudden rise in popularity correlates directly with these infusions of foreign capital." \n\nThe Prime Minister's expression darkened. "The timing is no coincidence." \n\n"No, sir. Intercepted communications suggest a coordinated attempt to install sympathetic voices in our government. The breach appears to extend into several ministries." \n\nAround the table, faces paled as implications settled in. Their democracy itself had been weaponized against them through golden handshakes and whispered promises."
adv_dip_event.82.a: "I'm sure it's nothing."
adv_dip_event.82.b: "Shutdown government. Force everyone out now."

adv_dip_event.91.t: "Scientific Espionage"
adv_dip_event.91.d: "Our agents have identified several opportunities to acquire technological secrets from [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. We must decide which field of research to focus our espionage efforts on."
adv_dip_event.91.f: "The intelligence director spread three dossiers across the desk, each detailing different technological targets within [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. \n\n"First, their industrial innovations—new manufacturing processes that could revolutionize our production methods. Second, their military advancements—particularly in the realm of artillery and naval design. Finally, their social institutions—education systems and civil engineering that have produced remarkable results." \n\nHe tapped each folder in turn. "We have the resources to pursue one avenue thoroughly. The question is: which secrets would best serve our nation's interests?""
adv_dip_event.91.a: "Their industrial methods could transform our economy."
adv_dip_event.91.b: "Military technology is vital for our security."
adv_dip_event.91.c: "Their societal advances could modernize our nation."
adv_dip_event.91.g: "Leave it for now."

adv_dip_event.92.t: "Technology Theft Discovered"
adv_dip_event.92.d: "Our security services have uncovered evidence of theft of our technological secrets."
adv_dip_event.92.f: "The Chief of Security's report made for grim reading. Foreign agents had thoroughly infiltrated our research institutions, making off with valuable technological data. \n\nBlueprints had been copied, research journals photographed, and in some cases, key personnel had been bribed to share sensitive information. The breach appeared systematic and well-organized, bearing all the hallmarks of state-sponsored espionage. \n\nMost concerning was the targeted nature of the theft—the spies knew exactly what they were looking for, suggesting a serious intelligence leak at the highest levels."
adv_dip_event.92.a: "Increase security immediately!"
adv_dip_event.92.b: "I'm sure it's nothing."

adv_dip_event.101.t: "Pirates Strike!"
adv_dip_event.101.d: "Our funded pirates have successfully raided [SCOPE.sCountry('piracy_target').GetName]'s merchant shipping!"
adv_dip_event.101.f: "The harbormaster's report arrived with news of another successful raid. Our 'privateers' had struck a devastating blow to [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]'s maritime commerce, seizing valuable cargo and disrupting their trade routes.\n\nWhile officially we maintain no connection to these raiders, their effectiveness in hampering our rival's trade brings a satisfied smile to our admiralty."
adv_dip_event.101.a: "Look at me. I am the captain now."

adv_dip_event.102.t: "Shipping Routes Disrupted"
adv_dip_event.102.d: "Pirates have been wreaking havoc on our merchant shipping!"
adv_dip_event.102.f: "The latest reports from our port authorities paint a grim picture. Pirates have been systematically targeting our merchant vessels, causing severe disruptions to our maritime trade. The attacks seem too coordinated to be mere chance - someone must be supporting these raiders.\n\nOur merchants demand action, but catching the true culprits may prove challenging."
adv_dip_event.102.a: "Pirates?! I hate those filthy bandits."

adv_dip_event.103.t: "The Calm After the Storm"
adv_dip_event.103.d: "The wave of pirate attacks against our shipping has finally begun to subside."
adv_dip_event.103.f: "After months of disruption, our maritime trade routes are finally returning to normal. The coordinated attacks that plagued our merchant vessels have mysteriously ceased, though the damage to our economy will take time to repair.\n\nWhile some suspect foreign involvement in the raids, proving such allegations would be difficult. For now, our merchants are simply relieved to resume their regular trading operations."
adv_dip_event.103.a: "Our ports can breathe easier."

adv_dip_event.110.t: "Knowledge Shared"
adv_dip_event.110.d: "Our development program in [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] has yielded promising results. Local scholars and engineers have embraced modern techniques, leading to notable improvements in their research capabilities."
adv_dip_event.110.f: "The lecture hall buzzed with excitement as local intellectuals eagerly absorbed the latest scientific principles. Our advisors had spent months carefully introducing modern methodologies, and now the results were becoming evident.\n\n'Their grasp of industrial concepts is remarkable,' the chief advisor reported. 'What might have taken decades of isolated development, they've assimilated in months. Several promising students have already proposed improvements to our original designs.'\n\nWhile ostensibly about modernization, this transfer of knowledge served our broader strategic interests. A developed [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName] would be a more valuable trading partner - and a more reliable ally."
adv_dip_event.110.a: "Knowledge lifts all nations."

adv_dip_event.120.t: "The Underground Railroad"
adv_dip_event.120.d: "Our network of abolitionists has successfully helped a group of enslaved people escape from [SCOPE.sCountry('spy_target_country').GetName]. They have sought refuge in our territory, bringing with them harrowing stories and a determination to build new lives in freedom."
adv_dip_event.120.f: "The safe house was quiet save for muffled sobs of relief. A dozen newly-freed souls huddled around a warm hearth, their arduous journey finally at an end. Their escape had been meticulously planned - sympathetic conductors, hidden compartments in wagons, forged papers prepared by our agents.\n\n'They'll be looking for us,' one woman whispered, clutching her infant closer.\n\n'Let them look,' the station master replied firmly. 'You're in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now. Here, you're free people.'\n\nAs word reached the capital, officials began the delicate process of settling the refugees while maintaining plausible deniability about their network's involvement."
adv_dip_event.120.a: "Welcome them to freedom."

These are no mere opportunistic raiders - their tactics suggest coordinated strikes funded by hostile powers. Our merchant vessels report increasing losses, trade efficiency is plummeting, and insurance rates are skyrocketing. Unless we take decisive action, these 'pirates' will continue to strangle our maritime commerce.\n\nOur port authorities recommend increasing security measures, while military advisors suggest direct action against known pirate havens. Some merchants have even proposed paying protection money to ensure safe passage."

adv_dip_assassination_event.103.a: "Good."

# Flavour Events
adv_dip_assassination_event.110.t: "Trouble in the Subway?"
adv_dip_assassination_event.110.d: "Our assassin lost track of the target for a couple of hours unfortunately. However, when they were strolling through the local town they sat down for a bite to eat at a local sandwich shop when, sat a couple of tables away, they found the target sitting and eating. After they left, the assassin found a note on the table with information about the target."
adv_dip_assassination_event.110.f: "The assassin slouched in the corner of the sandwich shop, hat pulled low over their eyes. A half-eaten ham and cheese sat forgotten as they observed their quarry three tables away. \n\n"Of all the sandwich shops in all the towns in all the world" the assassin muttered, carefully memorizing the target's companions and mannerisms. \n\nAs the target departed, a folded napkin caught the assassin's eye. Written in hurried script: meeting times, guard rotations, and a crude map of the residence. The assassin smiled. Fortune favors the patient—and the hungry."
adv_dip_assassination_event.110.a: "I do love a good sandwich."
adv_dip_assassination_event.110.b: "That's a load of bologne."

adv_dip_assassination_event.111.t: "A Cat A Day Puts the Target Away"
adv_dip_assassination_event.111.d: "Our assassin walked into one of the rooms, and out on the balcony was the target's cat. Speaking to the cat, the assassin realised it was giving him accurate intelligence on his schedule."
adv_dip_assassination_event.111.f: ""Curious creature" the assassin whispered, crouching beside the balcony railing. The target's tabby cat watched with unnerving intelligence, tail swishing methodically against the stone. \n\nEach time the assassin mentioned the target's name, the cat's ears twitched in a peculiar pattern. After an hour of this strange communion, the assassin had learned more about the target's habits than a week of conventional surveillance could provide. \n\nThe assassin scratched behind the cat's ears, considering. "Either you're the most remarkable feline in existence, or I've finally lost my mind." The cat simply purred in response."
adv_dip_assassination_event.111.a: "No witnesses. Push the cat."
adv_dip_assassination_event.111.b: "Keep our enemies close. Give him a stroke for me."

adv_dip_assassination_event.112.t: "Roses are Red, so are Cats"
adv_dip_assassination_event.112.d: "Our assassin was in the gardens when he stumbled upon a body on the floor. From the look of what's left it used to be a cat, it appears... dead? Maybe it fell off the balcony above."
adv_dip_assassination_event.112.f: "The assassin wandered through the garden's morning mist, inhaling the sweet scent of primrose. A flash of crimson among the bluebells caught their eye—the mangled remains of what appeared to be the target's prized feline. \n\n"Poor creature," the gardener remarked, appearing suddenly with his pruning shears. "Happened in the night. Found him just as you see him." \n\nThe assassin glanced upward at the balcony looming overhead. "A fall, you think?" \n\nThe old gardener shrugged. "Third such 'accident' this month. The master keeps replacing them—same color, same name. As if nobody would notice." He spat on the ground. "If you ask me, cats aren't the only things disposable in this household.""
adv_dip_assassination_event.112.a: "Clean up the mess, it's the right thing to do."
adv_dip_assassination_event.112.b: "I thought cats always land on their feet?"

adv_dip_assassination_event.113.t: "Chamber of Secrets"
adv_dip_assassination_event.113.d: "Our assassin was prowling about the rooms when a chambermaid pulled him aside, telling him foul stories of the target. The chambermaid gives us an offer: she will give us valuable information if we can guarantee her safety."
adv_dip_assassination_event.113.f: "The chambermaid's hands trembled as she clutched her apron. "I've worked in this household for eleven years," she whispered, eyes darting toward the hallway. "What I've seen would curdle your blood." \n\nThe assassin leaned closer. "If what you say is true—" \n\n"If?" She laughed, a brittle sound. "I can tell you when they sleep, what they eat, who visits their chambers at night. I can tell you things that would topple governments." Her expression hardened. "But first, I need assurances. \n\nWhen this is over, I need passage to Ostend and enough money to disappear." \n\nThe assassin considered the proposition, weighing loyalty against expediency."
adv_dip_assassination_event.113.a: "Agree, it's important to know what we're dealing with."
adv_dip_assassination_event.113.b: "Decline, we can't afford the risk."

adv_dip_assassination_event.114.t: "The Empire Strikes Back"
adv_dip_assassination_event.114.d: "An explosion goes off in our government building and an assassin is caught in the blast. The assassin is interrogated by our team and reveals a plot to assassinate [SCOPE.sCharacter('adv_dip_leader').GetFullName]."
adv_dip_assassination_event.114.f: "Glass crunched underfoot as emergency workers pulled bodies from the rubble. The government building's east wing lay in ruins, smoke still rising from blackened stone. \n\nIn a secure basement room, the captured assassin slumped in a chair, bloodied but defiant. "You think you're the only ones who can play this game?" they spat. "My employers send their regards." \n\nThe interrogator laid photographs before the prisoner—surveillance images of the nation's leader. "This ends now," he said quietly. "One way or another." \n\nOutside, as dusk fell, additional guards took position around the presidential residence. The game had escalated."
adv_dip_assassination_event.114.a: "Arrest the assassin and demand answers."
adv_dip_assassination_event.114.b: "Keep it quiet, remove the assassin."

adv_dip_assassination_event.115.t: "Do They Sink?"
adv_dip_assassination_event.115.d: "Whilst the assassin was exploring the local pubs they heard talk of a witch. The assassin visited the 'witch' in the woods, who told them that the target was a demon in disguise and offered them a herbal soup for our target to drink along with some very specific information about them should we pay them."
adv_dip_assassination_event.115.f: "Wind howled through the witch's ramshackle cottage as she stirred her cauldron with gnarled fingers. The assassin watched skeptically from the doorway. \n\n"Not a demon in the traditional sense," the crone muttered, adding dried herbs to her concoction. "But unnatural nonetheless. Drinks the youth from serving girls. Bathes in milk and blood." \n\nShe thrust forward a stoppered vial of murky liquid. "Three drops in his wine. No more. When he begins to sweat blood, you'll know it's working." \n\nThe assassin hesitated. The sum requested was considerable, but if even half her information proved accurate... \n\n"How did you come by such knowledge?" the assassin asked. \n\nThe witch's smile revealed blackened teeth. "I served his father. And his father's father.""
adv_dip_assassination_event.115.a: "Maybe we should trust in this magic."
adv_dip_assassination_event.115.b: "We'd have better luck with a magic 8 ball."

adv_dip_assassination_event.116.t: "A Bad Bog"
adv_dip_assassination_event.116.d: "The assassin was dealing with a poorly cooked chicken from the night before when they found some papers in the latrine. According to these papers, the target will be at an event in the town hall tomorrow."
adv_dip_assassination_event.116.f: "The assassin's stomach churned violently as they hunched in the foul-smelling latrine. Last night's chicken had been a grave mistake. \n\nWhile fumbling for scraps of cloth, their fingers brushed against paper tucked behind a loose stone. Retrieving it revealed a crumpled note—what appeared to be a schedule, hastily written. The target would be attending a municipal function the following evening. \n\nThe assassin carefully pocketed the paper, wincing as another wave of nausea struck. Intelligence could come from the most unexpected—and undignified—of places."
adv_dip_assassination_event.116.a: "Very interesting."
adv_dip_assassination_event.116.b: "We can't trust this information."

adv_dip_assassination_event.117.t: "Erfart"
adv_dip_assassination_event.117.d: "Whilst the assassin was partaking in a feast in the town hall, a support beam collapsed causing the floor to fail. Our assassin and multiple guests fell into the latrine cesspit that sat underneath the flooring, despite multiple attempts to rescue them they drowned in the filth. Luckily for us, this included our target."
adv_dip_assassination_event.117.f: "The town hall's grand feast was in full swing when the first ominous creaks echoed through the banquet hall. Guests exchanged nervous glances as dust rained from the ancient beams overhead. \n\nThe assassin, seated three places from the target, had just risen to excuse themselves when the floor gave way with a thunderous crack. Screams pierced the air as nobles, servants, and the assassin plunged into the fetid darkness below. \n\nRescue attempts continued through the night, lanterns illuminating the horror as bodies were recovered from the cesspit. Among them, ironically, lay the intended target—fate having accomplished what careful planning could not."
adv_dip_assassination_event.117.a: "At least the problem is dealt with."

adv_dip_assassination_event.118.t: "The Poison Chalice"
adv_dip_assassination_event.118.d: "There's a grand banquet held at the government building, with guests from all over the country. Our assassin was at this feast enjoying the salmon and caviar canapés they were serving when they saw an opportunity to poison the target's drink."
adv_dip_assassination_event.118.f: "Crystal glasses sparkled under candlelight as the orchestra played softly from the mezzanine. The assassin, dressed impeccably as a server, moved through the crowd with practiced ease. \n\nThe target sat at the head table, laughing boisterously at some diplomat's wit. The poisoned wine waited on the assassin's tray, indistinguishable from the others. \n\nA moment's distraction was all that was needed—a dropped fork, perhaps, or a toast. The assassin's fingers tightened around the stem of the glass, calculating angles and witnesses. One sip would be enough. One sip would change the course of nations."
adv_dip_assassination_event.118.a: "Try to poison their drink."
adv_dip_assassination_event.118.b: "Leave it for now, mingle and act normal instead. Gather intelligence on them."
adv_dip_assassination_event.118.c: "Poison their food and place the blame on [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target_country_leader').GetFullName]"

adv_dip_assassination_event.119.t: "Phantom of the Opera"
adv_dip_assassination_event.119.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName] is attending an Opera in the capital, with foreign dignataries in attenandance. This may provide opportunity for us."
adv_dip_assassination_event.119.f: "Opera glasses glinted in the darkness as the assassin scanned the ornate box seats. The target sat prominently displayed, surrounded by foreign dignitaries, all entranced by the soprano's aria. \n\nThe assassin checked the concealed weapon once more. The music would soon reach its crescendo, and with it, applause would thunder through the hall—the perfect cover for what was to come. \n\nA bead of sweat trickled down the assassin's temple. Timing was everything in opera, and in death."
adv_dip_assassination_event.119.a: "Take a shot during applause."
adv_dip_assassination_event.119.b: "Stage a fire in the building to cause chaos."
adv_dip_assassination_event.119.c: "Wait for a better moment."


adv_dip_assassination_event.120.t: "Return to Sender"
adv_dip_assassination_event.120.d: "Our assassin has been working for the target. Today they turned around and gave us an ultimatum: We either announce what we are doing publicly or pay them to keep quiet and cancel the mission."
adv_dip_assassination_event.120.f: "The coded message arrived by trusted courier, its contents chilling. The assassin—their own carefully selected agent—had switched allegiances. \n\n"Your window is closing," the Minister's advisor warned, placing the ultimatum on the polished desk. "They want payment to remain silent, or they go public with everything." \n\nThe Minister stared out at the rain-soaked gardens, calculating the political damage against treasury funds against personal reputation. \n\n"How much?" he finally asked. \n\n"More than we should pay," came the grim reply. "But perhaps less than what silence is worth.""
adv_dip_assassination_event.120.a: "We'll pay them off."
adv_dip_assassination_event.120.b: "I'm not giving away a penny."

adv_dip_assassination_event.122.t: "The Empire Strikes Back"
adv_dip_assassination_event.122.d: "An explosion goes off in our government building and the rubble crushes multiple civilians. Most of the government is safe and people are under care at the minute, in all of the chaos it appears [SCOPE.sCharacter('adv_dip_leader').GetFullName] was shot dead."
adv_dip_assassination_event.122.f: "Smoke still billowed from the government quarter as the Minister was briefed in the emergency bunker. His face grew ashen as the casualty reports came in. \n\n"Seventeen civilians dead. Forty-three wounded. And..." the aide hesitated, voice breaking. "Our leader was shot during evacuation. They didn't survive." \n\nOutside, church bells began to toll, the news spreading like wildfire through the capital. The retribution had been swift and brutal—an eye for an eye. \n\nThe Minister removed his spectacles, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "And our... operation? Against the foreign target?" \n\n"Still active, sir. Awaiting your command." \n\nThe weight of decision hung heavy in the stale bunker air."
adv_dip_assassination_event.122.a: "This is unnacceptable but me must continue our plot."
adv_dip_assassination_event.122.b: "We can't carry on with this."

adv_dip_assassination_event.123.t: "Checks and Balances"
adv_dip_assassination_event.123.d: "Whilst undergoing a routine check of the assassin's equipment, the target's guards found a hidden weapon. The assassin was taken into custody."
adv_dip_assassination_event.123.f: "The assassin's false identity had held for weeks—until the routine security check at the administrative building. The guard's eyes had narrowed at something imperceptible, leading to a more thorough search and the discovery of a slim blade concealed in a walking stick. \n\nNow the assassin sat in a windowless cell, face impassive as reports of the arrest crossed the Minister's desk thousands of miles away. \n\n"We're maintaining they're a common thief," the Secretary explained. "But their silence won't last forever." \n\nThe Minister tapped his pen rhythmically. "What are our extraction options?" \n\n"Limited, sir. Very limited.""
adv_dip_assassination_event.123.a: "Break them out. Do what we can."
adv_dip_assassination_event.123.b: "Send someone else, they're a lost cause."

adv_dip_assassination_event.124.t: "A Fungi Feeding"
adv_dip_assassination_event.124.d: "The assassin was prowling the gardens at night when they felt peckish, they found some mushrooms in one of the planters in the garden. Having little knowledge of mushrooms, they picked a few and ate them anyway. The next morning the assassin was found in the latrine, having been poisoned by the mushrooms."
adv_dip_assassination_event.124.f: "Dawn broke over the estate as servants discovered the assassin writhing on the latrine floor. Nearby lay the evidence—caps of death cap mushrooms, carelessly harvested from the groundskeeper's experimental garden. \n\n"Amateur mistake," the doctor muttered, forcing charcoal down the assassin's throat. "Eating unknown fungi in the dark. Might as well play Russian roulette." \n\nAs word reached the capital, the operation handler paced anxiously. Weeks of preparation, thousands in bribes, all potentially undone by a midnight snack. The question remained whether to abort the mission or gamble on recovery."
adv_dip_assassination_event.124.a: "Give them a couple of days and then they can carry on with the mission."
adv_dip_assassination_event.124.b: "Force them to carry on with the mission immediately, this simply isn't good enough."

adv_dip_assassination_event.125.t: "A Blade in the Shadows"
adv_dip_assassination_event.125.d: "Our assassin has been tracking the target for days when they notice a new figure following the same patterns. After careful observation, it appears we are not the only ones with designs on [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName]'s life. This presents an opportunity - or a complication."
adv_dip_assassination_event.125.f: "The assassin pressed against the damp stone wall, breath held as another shadow detached itself from the darkness across the street. For three nights now, this stranger had appeared wherever the target went. \n\n"Amateur," the assassin muttered, noting the figure's telltale hesitation at each corner. Yet amateur or not, their presence complicated matters considerably. \n\nA second hunter in this game meant either a valuable ally or a dangerous liability. Perhaps most intriguing was the question of who else wanted the target eliminated—and whether their interests aligned with those of the assassin's employers."
adv_dip_assassination_event.125.a: "Eliminate the competition. We can't risk interference."
adv_dip_assassination_event.125.b: "Continue as planned, but keep an eye out."

adv_dip_assassination_event.126.t: "The Double's Gambit"
adv_dip_assassination_event.126.d: "Our assassin has discovered that [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName] frequently uses a body double for public appearances. This explains several failed surveillance attempts, but also presents a new challenge in identifying the real target."
adv_dip_assassination_event.126.f: ""The resemblance is uncanny," the agent reported, sliding two nearly identical photographs across the table. "Same height, same build. Even the mannerisms are perfectly mirrored." \n\nThe spymaster studied the images with growing frustration. Weeks of planning, and now this complication. \n\n"How often does the switch occur?" \n\n"Unpredictably. Sometimes mid-event. The inner circle must know, but no one else." \n\nThe spymaster tapped a yellowed fingernail against his teeth. "Then we must either compromise someone in that circle, or find the one thing no double can replicate perfectly." \n\n"And that is?" \n\n"Habit, my dear. Deep, ingrained habit. Everyone has tells—even those who pretend to be someone else.""
adv_dip_assassination_event.126.a: "Focus on identifying the real target before proceeding."
adv_dip_assassination_event.126.b: "Eliminate both. We can't afford to miss."

adv_dip_assassination_event.127.t: "The Poisoner's Dilemma"
adv_dip_assassination_event.127.d: "Our assassin has successfully infiltrated the kitchen staff and has been slowly poisoning [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName] with an untraceable substance. However, the target's personal physician has begun to suspect something is amiss and has ordered changes to the target's diet."
adv_dip_assassination_event.127.f: "Steam billowed as the assassin stirred the simmering pot, face impassive despite the nervous energy coursing through their veins. For weeks, they had been adding minute traces of arsenic to the target's favorite dishes—not enough for immediate effect, but sufficient for a gradual, "natural" decline. \n\nToday, however, the routine had been interrupted. The physician had arrived unannounced, demanding to inspect the pantry and ordering a completely new menu. \n\n"His Excellency's stomach is delicate," the physician announced, eyeing the kitchen staff suspiciously. "From now on, he will have a personal food taster." \n\nThe assassin nodded deferentially, mind racing. The careful balance of patience and poison had been disrupted. Adaptation would be necessary."
adv_dip_assassination_event.127.a: "Switch to a faster-acting poison, consequences be damned."
adv_dip_assassination_event.127.b: "Abandon this approach and seek another vulnerability."

adv_dip_assassination_event.128.t: "The Confession Box"
adv_dip_assassination_event.128.d: "Our assassin has learned that [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName] is deeply religious and visits the same church for confession every week. This predictable pattern presents an opportunity for an ambush, though churches are considered sacred ground by many."
adv_dip_assassination_event.128.f: "Rain drummed against the cathedral's stained glass as the assassin slipped into a pew, prayer book raised to obscure their face. The target knelt two rows ahead, head bowed in apparent devotion. \n\nEvery Thursday, same time, same confessional. A creature of habit—or perhaps genuinely burdened by sin. Either way, it was the one place where the ever-present guards relaxed their vigilance. \n\nThe assassin observed the ornate confessional booth, calculating angles and escape routes. To strike in such a place would shock the nation, possibly turning their target into a martyr. But opportunities this perfect were rare. \n\nFootsteps echoed as the target rose, moving toward the waiting priest. The assassin's hand drifted to the concealed weapon. Faith and politics had always made dangerous bedfellows."
adv_dip_assassination_event.128.a: "Strike during confession. The privacy is perfect."
adv_dip_assassination_event.128.b: "This is sacrilege. Find another opportunity."

adv_dip_assassination_event.129.t: "The Seduction Stratagem"
adv_dip_assassination_event.129.d: "Our assassin has cultivated a romantic relationship with one of [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName]'s close household staff. The relationship has progressed to the point where our agent has significant access to the target's private quarters, but emotional complications have arisen."
adv_dip_assassination_event.129.f: "The letter lay open on the desk, its flowery script a stark contrast to the clinical intelligence report beside it. \n\n"My dearest," it began, followed by effusive declarations of affection from the target's lady-in-waiting—now hopelessly enamored with their assassin. \n\nThe spymaster frowned, scanning the agent's latest dispatch. Access to the bedchamber achieved. Knowledge of the guard rotations secured. Poison placed within reach of the evening tea service. \n\nEverything proceeding according to plan, except for one critical detail: their assassin was showing signs of genuine attachment. Phrases like "reconsidering options" and "bloodless alternatives" had begun appearing in the reports. \n\nThe oldest complication in espionage—the human heart interfering with matters of state."
adv_dip_assassination_event.129.a: "Recall the assassin. They're compromised by emotion."
adv_dip_assassination_event.129.b: "Pressure them to complete the mission immediately."


adv_dip_assassination_event.134.t: "Revival of the Fittest"
adv_dip_assassination_event.134.d: "The assassin has successfully recovered from the poisoning and is ready to carry on with the mission."
adv_dip_assassination_event.134.f: ""Remarkable constitution" the physician remarked, checking the assassin's pulse. "Most would be dead or permanently damaged after ingesting those particular mushrooms." \n\nThe assassin sat up gingerly, still pale but clear-eyed. "When can I resume my duties?" \n\nBack at headquarters, the news of recovery was received with palpable relief. The operation timeline could be maintained, though with stern new protocols regarding unauthorized foraging. \n\n"Tell them to stick to the food we've authenticated," the handler instructed the messenger. "And perhaps pack some additional antidotes."."
adv_dip_assassination_event.134.a: "Fantastic news. Tell them to never eat anything ever again."

adv_dip_assassination_event.135.t: "Silencing the Shadow"
adv_dip_assassination_event.135.d: "Our assassin has successfully eliminated the unknown rival who was tracking our target. While searching the body, they discovered concerning documents linking the dead assassin to [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_rival_country_leader').GetFullName]."
adv_dip_assassination_event.135.f: "Blood pooled beneath the stranger's body in the narrow alleyway, black in the moonlight. Our assassin methodically searched the corpse, retrieving a stiletto of unusual craftsmanship and a waterproof leather case tucked inside the lining of the coat. \n\nInside lay orders written in cipher, a diplomatic wax seal hastily broken at the edge, and a detailed map of the target's residence marked with entry points our own intelligence had missed. \n\nThe assassin committed the documents to memory before striking a match. As the papers curled into ash, their mind raced with implications. This rival had been well-funded, well-informed—and now, their masters would be expecting reports that would never come. \n\nThe game had new players. And by eliminating one piece, our assassin may have inadvertently announced our own presence on the board."
adv_dip_assassination_event.135.a: "Accelerate our timeline. We must strike before their absence is noted."

# Successful Final Event
adv_dip_assassination_event.198.t: "Another One Bites the Dust"
adv_dip_assassination_event.198.d: "Our foreign operation has successfully completed and reports are coming back of [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName] going missing. It's an unfortunate circumstance."
adv_dip_assassination_event.198.f: "The Foreign Minister adjusted his cravat in the mirror, face carefully composed into an expression of appropriate solemnity. \n\n"Tragic business," he remarked to his aide as they prepared for the press conference. "To think that someone of such prominence could simply... vanish." \n\nBehind closed doors, a sealed telegram lay on his desk, its contents brief: "The matter has been resolved. Payment to be delivered as agreed." \n\nThe Minister allowed himself a small, satisfied smile before arranging his features back into a mask of concern. The world stage had one fewer actor tonight."
adv_dip_assassination_event.198.a: "Marvelous"

# Failed Final Event
adv_dip_assassination_event.199.t: "No Time to Die"
adv_dip_assassination_event.199.d: "Our foreign agents were outmaneuvered and [SCOPE.sCharacter('assassination_target').GetFullName] got away. There was attempts but unfortunately none successful. We can't risk another attempt."
adv_dip_assassination_event.199.f: "Rain lashed against the windows of the Foreign Ministry as the coded message was decrypted. The Minister's face darkened with each line. \n\n"Compromised," he finally said, sliding the paper across to his deputy. "The target was warned. Our agents scattered." \n\nYears of planning, millions in resources, countless risks taken—all for nothing.
