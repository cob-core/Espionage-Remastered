+ Prepped Steal Commander action, event, and localisation.  
+ Prepped Develop Nation action, event, and localisation.  
+ Reduced 'Fund Nationalists' chance as it was set high for testing and accidently left in.

+ Double the amount of influence gained from the institution per level to encourage more competition and espionage.  
+ Increased AI chance to pass the Espionage law; if they are a major power and above they consider it of national importance.

+ Added action, events, and modifiers for Support Slaves.  
+ Replaced some static event costs with dynamic ones relevant to the event, as the static costs don't scale with country size.

+ Increased chance of election interference event triggering.
